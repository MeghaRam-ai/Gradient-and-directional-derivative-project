# Gradient-and-directional-derivative-project

## Instructions
The point of this project is to code a application in Python that takes the coordinates of a point in R² (given by the user), the components of a vector (also given by the user) and calculates the directional derivative of the function f(x,y) = x³y - xy³ at this point.



It is required from you to write a Python code that:

- asks the user to enter the coordinates x and y of a point in R²
- calculates the gradient of the function f(x,y) = x³y - xy³ at this point
- handles the case where the user writes non numerical values
- asks the user the components of the vector u
- creates a unit vector u' out of u
- computes the directional derivative of f at the point given by the user in the direction of the vector u (also given by the user)
